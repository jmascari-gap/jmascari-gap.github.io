leave functions, the\n * behavior of the visitor can be altered, including skipping over a sub-tree of\n * the AST (by returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null\n * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.\n *\n * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original AST will not be modified, and\n * a new version of the AST with the changes applied will be returned from the\n * visit function.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const editedAST = visit(ast, {\n *   enter(node, key, parent, path, ancestors) {\n *     // @return\n *     //   undefined: no action\n
